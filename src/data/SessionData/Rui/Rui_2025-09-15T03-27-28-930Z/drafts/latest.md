Subject: Inquiry Regarding Potential Studentship Extension - [Your Name]

Dear Professor [Supervisor's Last Name],

I hope you're having a good week.

I'm writing to you today regarding my studentship and to explore the possibility of a short extension. As my current studentship is due to conclude on [Your Current End Date], I've been reviewing my progress and final project milestones. While I've been working diligently and feel confident about the overall trajectory of my research, I've found that [briefly and concisely state a legitimate, project-related reason, e.g., "the final phase of data analysis is proving more complex than anticipated," or "there are a few critical experiments I'd like to finalize to strengthen my key findings for publication," or "I'd like to dedicate more focused time to refining my thesis and preparing manuscripts for submission"].

To ensure I can bring my project to the strongest possible conclusion and maximize the impact of our work, I believe an additional three months would be incredibly beneficial. Therefore, I was hoping to inquire about the possibility of extending my studentship by three months, until [New Proposed End Date], to cover my living costs during this crucial final period.

I apologize for raising this relatively close to the conclusion of my current funding, but I wanted to explore if an extension might be feasible. Your guidance is invaluable as always.

I'm very keen to discuss this further with you at your convenience and explore any potential solutions or alternative plans we might consider. Please let me know if a short meeting would be possible.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warmly,

[Your Name]
