      "modification_name": "Introduce salary discussion more gently and seek feedback",
      "original_text": "Based on my experience level, the responsibilities outlined for this role, and my understanding of current market rates for similar positions, I was hoping we could explore a salary closer to [mention your desired range or figure if comfortable, or say \"a slightly higher figure\"]. I've really put a lot of thought into this, and I believe this figure accurately reflects the value and expertise I would bring to the team from day one.",
      "revised_text": "Regarding the compensation package we discussed, I was hoping to chat a bit further about the salary component. Based on my experience level, the responsibilities outlined for this role, and my understanding of current market rates for similar positions, I was wondering if there might be an opportunity to explore a salary closer to [mention your desired range or figure if comfortable, or say \"a slightly higher figure\"]. I've really put a lot of thought into this, and I believe this figure would accurately reflect the value and expertise I would bring to the team from day one, and I'm keen to hear your thoughts.",
      "modification_reason": "The user introduced a softer, more conversational opening to the salary discussion by referencing the previously discussed compensation package and explicitly stating a desire to 'chat a bit further about the salary component.' This makes the request less direct and more collaborative. Additionally, the user added 'and I'm keen to hear your thoughts' at the end, shifting the tone from a direct statement of desired salary to an invitation for discussion and feedback, aligning with the goal to 'avoid losing the opportunity to join this company' and 'highlight relationship maintaining do not hurt relationship' while managing the 'Receiver is higher' power difference.",
      "receiver_description": "An HR contact who has established some familiarity and was previously nice to the sender. The receiver is in a higher position of power, and maintaining a positive relationship is crucial for the sender.",
      "occasion_description": "A follow-up email after an interview to argue for a higher salary, while also conveying enthusiasm for the role and company, and carefully managing the request to avoid appearing greedy or ungrateful, and to preserve the good relationship with the HR contact."

I believe this adjustment would more fully align with the value and expertise I am eager to contribute to the team from day one, and I would genuinely appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further.",
      "modification_reason": "The user wanted to make the salary request sound less demanding and more appreciative, aligning with the desire to 'cherish this opportunity' and 'avoid feeling I am asking for benefits that does not deserve me' or 'greedy'. The original phrasing 'I've really put a lot of thought into this, and I believe this figure would accurately reflect...' could be perceived as assertive. The revised phrasing 'I believe this adjustment would more fully align with the value and expertise I am eager to contribute... and I would genuinely appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further' softens the tone by framing it as an alignment rather than a firm demand and explicitly expressing appreciation for the discussion opportunity.",
      "receiver_description": "An HR contact at a company, who is perceived as friendly and with whom a certain degree of familiarity has been established through previous interview rounds. The receiver is in a higher position of power.",
      "occasion_description": "A follow-up email after a job interview, where the sender is expressing enthusiasm for the role and initiating a discussion about salary negotiation. The goal is to ask for a higher salary without appearing greedy or ungrateful, and without jeopardizing the job opportunity, while maintaining a positive relationship."

      "modification_name": "Soften directness and add an immediate inquiry for flexibility",
      "original_text": "I saw that the \"Motion Sickness\" manuscript is nearing submission, which is fantastic news – I'm really excited about this project. I've been reflecting on my contributions, and I was wondering if there might be any flexibility regarding the author order. I noticed I'm currently listed as the 4th author.",
      "revised_text": "I saw that the \"Motion Sickness\" manuscript is nearing submission, which is fantastic news – I'm genuinely excited about this project! As we're finalizing everything, I've been thinking about the author order. I noticed I'm currently listed as the 4th author, and I wanted to gently inquire if there might be any flexibility there.",
      "modification_reason": "The user felt the original text was too direct in immediately stating the author order concern without a smoother transition or a direct, softened inquiry. The revision introduces a 'thinking about the author order' phrase and immediately follows up with a 'gently inquire if there might be any flexibility there' to make the introduction of the topic less abrupt and less 'emotional' as per the user's feedback, reducing the perceived 'hurry' and softening the tone.",
      "receiver_description": "Academic supervisor with whom the sender has a familiar, warm, and frequent research-related interaction, but still maintains a professional student-supervisor hierarchy. The supervisor is higher in power, and the sender wants to maintain the relationship.",
      "occasion_description": "A personal email from a student to their supervisor about an upcoming research paper submission, specifically inquiring about a possible change in author order. The request is meant to be a 'slight ask' with a focus on maintaining the relationship regardless of the outcome, avoiding appearing greedy or causing inconvenience."

      "modification_name": "Shift from formal/generic to natural/familiar opening pleasantry",
      "original_text": "I hope this email finds you well.",
      "revised_text": "Hope you're doing well.",
      "modification_reason": "The user found the original phrasing 'I hope this email finds you well' to be too generic and 'AI-like', indicating a preference for more natural, less formal language. The revision to 'Hope you're doing well' makes the opening pleasantry feel more personal and aligned with a familiar yet respectful student-supervisor relationship, satisfying the 'Friendly / Warm' affiliation and 'familiar' but 'respectful' familiarity factors.",
      "receiver_description": "Academic supervisor with whom the sender has a friendly and familiar, but still respectful, professional relationship. The receiver holds a higher position.",
      "occasion_description": "A student is writing an email to their academic supervisor to humbly request a three-month extension for their studentship, aiming to maintain a good relationship and convey a cautious and empathetic tone."

      "revised_text": "I'm writing to you today with a request, and I wanted to gently explore with you the possibility of a three-month extension to my studentship, should that be feasible.",
      "modification_reason": "The user added 'with you' to make the request more collaborative and 'should that be feasible' to express greater caution, acknowledge the supervisor's potential constraints, and reduce any perceived pressure. This aligns with the user's desire to be cautious, respectful of the power difference, and avoid making the supervisor feel burdened or to appear demanding.",
      "receiver_description": "Academic supervisor; higher in hierarchy; familiar relationship requiring respect; needs to be approached empathetically but without pressure; maintaining a good relationship is crucial.",
      "occasion_description": "A student is writing an email to their academic supervisor to request a three-month extension for their studentship. The request needs to be framed cautiously and respectfully, acknowledging potential administrative and financial considerations, and emphasizing the continuation of a positive working relationship."

      "modification_name": "Mitigate pressure by acknowledging refusal possibility",
      "original_text": "I understand that extensions involve administrative considerations, and I'm keen to discuss this further with you at your convenience. I am also happy to outline a detailed plan for these three months to show how I would effectively utilize this additional time.\n\nThank you so much for your continuous support and guidance throughout my studentship. I truly value our working relationship and your mentorship.",
      "revised_text": "I understand that extensions involve administrative considerations, and I'm keen to discuss this further with you at your convenience. I am also happy to outline a detailed plan for these three months to show how I would effectively utilize this additional time. Of course, I completely understand if this isn't possible, and I'm prepared to work within the existing timeframe if an extension cannot be granted. Thank you so much for your continuous support and guidance throughout my studentship. I truly value our working relationship and your mentorship.",
      "modification_reason": "The user added a phrase to explicitly acknowledge the possibility of the request being denied. This was done to reduce pressure on the supervisor, aligning with the user's desire to 'give the audience less pressure' and to convey being 'cautious, just an attempt to ask any possibilities' while avoiding making the supervisor 'under pressure' or making the sender feel 'poor or begging'. It shows preparedness for either outcome, reinforcing respect for the supervisor's decision and administrative constraints.",

The communication aims to be respectful, cautious, and maintain the good working relationship, acknowledging the supervisor's higher status and potential administrative considerations, while avoiding sounding demanding or greedy."
