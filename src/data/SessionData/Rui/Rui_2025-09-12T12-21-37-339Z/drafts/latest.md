Subject: Checking In & Studentship Extension Request - [Your Name]

Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I'm writing to you with some difficult personal news. My father has unfortunately fallen quite ill recently, and this has naturally been a very challenging time for my family and me. While I've been trying my best to balance everything, it has inevitably impacted my ability to fully focus on my studies and research progress as I would normally.

Given the circumstances, I was hoping to discuss the possibility of extending my studentship for an additional three months. I believe this would give me the necessary time and space to navigate my family situation while also ensuring I can get back on track with my project and complete it to the best of my ability, without feeling undue pressure.

I'm committed to my work and want to ensure I deliver high-quality research, and I believe this extension would be incredibly helpful in allowing me to do so effectively once things stabilize a little.

Would you be open to chatting about this sometime next week when you have a moment? I'm happy to provide more details then.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
