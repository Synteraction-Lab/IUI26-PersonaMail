Subject: Request for Studentship Extension – [Your Name]

Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to respectfully request a three-month extension to my current studentship, which is currently scheduled to conclude on Jan 5.

I have been working diligently on my research, and while significant progress has been made, unforeseen external circumstances have presented some challenges that have slightly impacted my timeline. These have primarily involved [mention an external factor, e.g., unexpected delays in accessing a critical resource, a hold-up with ethics approval, or disruptions due to a particular global event]. I believe a short extension would be incredibly beneficial in ensuring I can complete my project to the highest possible standard and achieve the quality outcomes we are both striving for.

I am fully committed to bringing this project to a successful conclusion and have already started outlining a revised work plan for the extended period. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further with you at your convenience, perhaps in the coming week, to share my proposed plan and explore the feasibility of this extension.

Your guidance and support throughout my studentship have been invaluable, and I am very grateful for your mentorship. I am confident that with this additional time, I can deliver a truly impactful and comprehensive thesis.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
