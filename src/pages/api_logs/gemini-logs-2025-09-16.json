Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects.

Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects. Ensure the output is only the JSON array and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n\r\n   {\"dimension\":\"…\",\"current\\_value\":\"…\",\"other\\_values\":\\[\"…\",\"…\",\"…\"\\]},\r\n\r\n   …\r\n\r\n\\]  \r\n"

As my current studentship approaches its end, I've been carefully reviewing my progress and project timeline. To ensure I can bring my research to the strongest possible conclusion, and to adequately address a few remaining areas, I was wondering if it might be possible to extend my studentship for an additional three months.\n\nI understand the implications of such a request and want to assure you that I've thought this through carefully. My aim is to deliver the best possible outcome for my research, and I believe this additional time would be invaluable in achieving that. I'm keen to discuss my current progress and how an extension would allow me to finalize key aspects of my work.\n\nOf course, I completely understand if this isn't feasible, and I appreciate your consideration of my situation. Regardless of the outcome, I remain fully committed to my research and our collaborative efforts. I'm grateful for all the support and guidance you've provided throughout my studentship.\n\nWould you be open to chatting sometime next week to discuss this further, perhaps during your office hours or at a time that suits you?\n\nThank you for your time and understanding.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\r\n**Selected content to revise:**  \r\nI hope this email finds you well.\r\n- **Adaptive Stylebook**: {\n  \"revision_records\": [\n    {\n      \"modification_name\": \"Introduce salary discussion more gently and seek feedback\",\n      \"original_text\": \"Based on my experience level, the responsibilities outlined for this role, and my understanding of current market rates for similar positions, I was hoping we could explore a salary closer to [mention your desired range or figure if comfortable, or say \\\"a slightly higher figure\\\"].

You will create a list of \"Intents\" as `[Dimension, Value]` pairs. These intents represent the strategy that was actually adopted in the current draft email and potential other ways to express them, making the underlying decisions transparent and editable.\r\n\r\n1. **Dimension:**  \r\n    \r\n   * A `dimension` is a critical decision you need to make about the email's content, structure, or tone. Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects.

You will create a list of \"Intents\" as `[Dimension, Value]` pairs. These intents represent the strategy that was actually adopted in the current draft email and potential other ways to express them, making the underlying decisions transparent and editable.\r\n\r\n1. **Dimension:**  \r\n    \r\n   * A `dimension` is a critical decision you need to make about the email's content, structure, or tone. Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects. Ensure the output is only the JSON array and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n\r\n   {\"dimension\":\"…\",\"current\\_value\":\"…\",\"other\\_values\":\\[\"…\",\"…\",\"…\"\\]},\r\n\r\n   …\r\n\r\n\\]  \r\n",

I'm really excited about the progress we've made and the potential impact of this research.\n\nAs I've been reflecting on my contributions to the project, particularly [mention specific contributions briefly, e.g., \"my efforts in designing the experiments,\" \"my significant work on the data analysis,\" or \"my role in drafting the manuscript's initial sections\"], I was wondering if there might be any possibility of considering me for first authorship.\n\nI understand that authorship decisions are complex and involve many factors, and I truly value our collaborative environment and your guidance throughout this project. My primary aim is always to contribute meaningfully to our team's success.\n\nOf course, I completely respect your final decision, whatever it may be. My hope is simply to explore this possibility while maintaining our positive working relationship, which is very important to me.\n\nThank you for considering my request. I'm happy to chat more about this at your convenience.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\r\n\r\n**Instructions:**\r\n\r\nYour goal is to make your writing strategy explicit and editable for the user. You will create a list of \"Intents\" as `[Dimension, Value]` pairs. These intents represent the strategy that was actually adopted in the current draft email and potential other ways to express them, making the underlying decisions transparent and editable.\r\n\r\n1. **Dimension:**  \r\n    \r\n   * A `dimension` is a critical decision you need to make about the email's content, structure, or tone. Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects. Ensure the output is only the JSON array and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n\r\n   {\"dimension\":\"…\",\"current\\_value\":\"…\",\"other\\_values\":\\[\"…\",\"…\",\"…\"\\]},\r\n\r\n   …\r\n\r\n\\]  \r\n"

Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects.

Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects. Ensure the output is only the JSON array and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n\r\n   {\"dimension\":\"…\",\"current\\_value\":\"…\",\"other\\_values\":\\[\"…\",\"…\",\"…\"\\]},\r\n\r\n   …\r\n\r\n\\]  \r\n"

You will create a list of \"Intents\" as `[Dimension, Value]` pairs. These intents represent the strategy that was actually adopted in the current draft email and potential other ways to express them, making the underlying decisions transparent and editable.\r\n\r\n1. **Dimension:**  \r\n    \r\n   * A `dimension` is a critical decision you need to make about the email's content, structure, or tone. Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects.

For each intent, identify which components it should influence.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Guidelines**\r\n\r\n- **Many-to-Many Relationships**: One intent can influence multiple components, and one component can be shaped by multiple intents\r\n- **Strategic Cascading**: Consider how high-level communication goals (intents) cascade across functional areas (components)\r\n- **Functional Alignment**: Link intents to components where the intent's strategic approach would meaningfully impact the component's execution\r\n- **Avoid Over-Linking**: Only create links where there's a clear, logical connection between the intent's strategy and the component's communicative function\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Output Format**\r\n\r\nReturn a JSON array of relationship objects. Each object links one intent (by dimension) to one component (by ID). Do not include any commentary or explanations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Example Output**\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"intent_dimension\": \"Request_Style\", \r\n    \"component_id\": \"statement_of_purpose\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"intent_dimension\": \"Request_Style\",\r\n    \"component_id\": \"call_to_action\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"intent_dimension\": \"Relationship_Preservation\",\r\n    \"component_id\": \"opening_salutation\"\r\n  }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n````"

I'm finding [mention something positive or interesting about your work] and am enthusiastic about the direction it's taking.\n\nI've been thinking about the next steps and how I can continue to contribute effectively. I was wondering if there might be any opportunity for a 3-month studentship, perhaps starting around [suggest a rough start month, e.g., \"this summer\" or \"after my current project concludes\"]. I believe this additional time would allow me to [briefly mention a specific benefit, e.g., \"delve deeper into X,\" \"complete the Y experiment,\" or \"prepare a stronger manuscript for Z\"].\n\nI understand that funding and opportunities can be limited, and I certainly don't want to cause any inconvenience or pressure. I just wanted to cautiously inquire if such a possibility might align with any ongoing projects or available resources in the lab. If not, I completely understand, and I'm still very much committed to my current work and our research goals.\n\nThank you for considering my request. I truly value our collaboration and your guidance, and I'm always keen to discuss how I can best support our research.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\r\n**Selected content to revise:**  \r\nI hope this email finds you well.\r\n- **Adaptive Stylebook**: {\n  \"revision_records\": [\n    {\n      \"modification_name\": \"Introduce salary discussion more gently and seek feedback\",\n      \"original_text\": \"Based on my experience level, the responsibilities outlined for this role, and my understanding of current market rates for similar positions, I was hoping we could explore a salary closer to [mention your desired range or figure if comfortable, or say \\\"a slightly higher figure\\\"].
