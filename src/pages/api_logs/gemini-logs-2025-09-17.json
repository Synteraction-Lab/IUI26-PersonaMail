Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects.

Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects. Ensure the output is only the JSON array and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n\r\n   {\"dimension\":\"…\",\"current\\_value\":\"…\",\"other\\_values\":\\[\"…\",\"…\",\"…\"\\]},\r\n\r\n   …\r\n\r\n\\]  \r\n"

Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects.

I’m very committed to the project and believe this extra time would significantly enhance the final product.\n\nI understand that studentship extensions are not always straightforward, and I wanted to approach this cautiously to see if there might be any avenues or possibilities we could explore. I'm happy to discuss my progress in more detail and outline how these additional three months would be utilized to achieve specific milestones.\n\nThank you very much for considering my request. I truly value your guidance and support throughout my studies, and I'm keen to ensure the successful completion of my research.

Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects.

Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects. Ensure the output is only the JSON array and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n\r\n   {\"dimension\":\"…\",\"current\\_value\":\"…\",\"other\\_values\":\\[\"…\",\"…\",\"…\"\\]},\r\n\r\n   …\r\n\r\n\\]  \r\n"

You will create a list of \"Intents\" as `[Dimension, Value]` pairs. These intents represent the strategy that was actually adopted in the current draft email and potential other ways to express them, making the underlying decisions transparent and editable.\r\n\r\n1. **Dimension:**  \r\n    \r\n   * A `dimension` is a critical decision you need to make about the email's content, structure, or tone. Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects.

These intents represent the strategy that was actually adopted in the current draft email and potential other ways to express them, making the underlying decisions transparent and editable.\r\n\r\n1. **Dimension:**  \r\n    \r\n   * A `dimension` is a critical decision you need to make about the email's content, structure, or tone. Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects. Ensure the output is only the JSON array and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n\r\n   {\"dimension\":\"…\",\"current\\_value\":\"…\",\"other\\_values\":\\[\"…\",\"…\",\"…\"\\]},\r\n\r\n   …\r\n\r\n\\]  \r\n"

These have primarily involved [mention a neutral, general challenge, e.g., unexpected complexities in data analysis, a slight delay in experimental procedures, or the need for additional refinement of a specific chapter]. I believe a short extension would be incredibly beneficial in ensuring I can complete my project to the highest possible standard and achieve the quality outcomes we are both striving for.\n\nI am fully committed to bringing this project to a successful conclusion and have already started outlining a revised work plan for the extended period. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further with you at your convenience, perhaps in the coming week, to share my proposed plan and explore the feasibility of this extension.\n\nYour guidance and support throughout my studentship have been invaluable, and I am very grateful for your mentorship. I am confident that with this additional time, I can deliver a truly impactful and comprehensive thesis.\n\nThank you for considering my request.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

You will create a list of \"Intents\" as `[Dimension, Value]` pairs. These intents represent the strategy that was actually adopted in the current draft email and potential other ways to express them, making the underlying decisions transparent and editable.\r\n\r\n1. **Dimension:**  \r\n    \r\n   * A `dimension` is a critical decision you need to make about the email's content, structure, or tone. Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects. Ensure the output is only the JSON array and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n\r\n   {\"dimension\":\"…\",\"current\\_value\":\"…\",\"other\\_values\":\\[\"…\",\"…\",\"…\"\\]},\r\n\r\n   …\r\n\r\n\\]  \r\n",

I believe a short extension would be incredibly beneficial in ensuring I can complete my project to the highest possible standard and achieve the quality outcomes we are both striving for.\n\nI am fully committed to bringing this project to a successful conclusion and have already started outlining a revised work plan for the extended period. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further with you at your convenience, perhaps in the coming week, to share my proposed plan and explore the feasibility of this extension.\n\nYour guidance and support throughout my studentship have been invaluable, and I am very grateful for your mentorship. I am confident that with this additional time, I can deliver a truly impactful and comprehensive thesis.\n\nThank you for considering my request.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\r\n\r\n**Instructions:**\r\n\r\nYour goal is to make your writing strategy explicit and editable for the user. You will create a list of \"Intents\" as `[Dimension, Value]` pairs. These intents represent the strategy that was actually adopted in the current draft email and potential other ways to express them, making the underlying decisions transparent and editable.\r\n\r\n1. **Dimension:**  \r\n    \r\n   * A `dimension` is a critical decision you need to make about the email's content, structure, or tone. Think of it as a \"hypothesis\" for how to handle a specific aspect of the email.  \r\n   * It should be a concise, descriptive title for a category of choices.  \r\n   * **Example:** If the user wants to ask their former supervisor for a postdoc position and inquire about the salary, a good `dimension` would be \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" or \"Approach to Formality\".\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. **current\\_value:**  \r\n    \r\n   * The `current\\_value` describes how current email executes for that `dimension`.  \r\n   * It MUST be a short, glanceable set of keywords (2-5 words), NOT a full sentence.  \r\n   * **Example:** For the \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" dimension, a good `value` could be \"Cautious with justification\", \"Direct and explicit\", or \"Brief, subtle mention\".\r\n\r\n3. **Other Values:**  \r\n    \r\n   * For each dimension, brainstorm 3-4 alternative approaches that could also work but weren't selected as the primary choice.  \r\n   * These alternatives help the user understand the full range of options and can be easily swapped in if they disagree with your primary suggestion.  \r\n   * **Example:** For \"Salary Discussion Strategy\" with primary value \"Cautious with justification\", alternatives might include \"Direct and explicit\", \"Defer to later conversation\", or \"No mention initially\".\r\n\r\n4. **Overall:**  \r\n    \r\n   * Generate approximately 3-5 of these `[Dimension, Value]` pairs.  \r\n   * Focus on the most important and nuanced decisions. Avoid generic dimensions like \"Greeting\" unless there's a specific, non-obvious choice to be made.  \r\n   * The output should act as a bridge, translating the user's abstract request into a concrete, editable plan for you to follow when you generate the draft.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:** Return the result strictly as a JSON array of objects. Ensure the output is only the JSON array and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n\r\n   {\"dimension\":\"…\",\"current\\_value\":\"…\",\"other\\_values\":\\[\"…\",\"…\",\"…\"\\]},\r\n\r\n   …\r\n\r\n\\]  \r\n"
